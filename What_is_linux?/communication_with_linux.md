- pwd- tells me where I am, for example home
- ls- lists my files
- cd- lets me go into a folder
- mkdir- creates a directory (from what I understand a containor of files)
- touch- creates an empty file
- nano- fileexample.txt- creates a mimi playground for you to edit file in
- cat: prints the contents of a file
- ctrl O saves file, ctrl X exits file in nano
- #!/bin/bash: tells linux to run this file on the bash interpreter
- read text: whatever comes after read is stored in the variable name, so here name = text
- $variable: print that variable
- mv file file: changes a files name, can add /place/place to make it go into a different directory or general place
- find file/directory: lists a directory and or file and everything in it

UNSURE:
- echo "what is this" > file_example.txt: echo seems to create a file and store information inside it
- chmod +x script.sh: reads file line by line and gives permission?
