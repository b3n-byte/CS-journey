- pwd- tells me where I am, for example home
- ls- lists my files
- cd- lets me go into a folder
- mkdir- creates a directory (from what I understand a containor of files)
- touch- creates an empty file
- nano- fileexample.txt- creates a mimi playground for you to edit file in
- cat: prints the contents of a file
- chmod +x script.sh: reads file line by line and gives permission?

UNSURE:
- echo "what is this" > file_example.txt: echo seems to create a file and store information inside it
