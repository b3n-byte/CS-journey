ACCESS
- non-standard groups are of interest, I don't know much about this in particular yet but I know that the number infront is
liklely to be different than 1000
- the adm group means user has access to /var/log files (see structure and shell.md) and could be used to access ensitive information
- membership in the sudo group means user has limited or full access to the all-powerfull root commands

SYSTEM INFORMATION
- uname can give much info about our targets system, for example find the kernel version and search for exploits of that version
