TOOLS:
- ls: shows files and directorys
- man <tool>, 'man' and the syntax you want to understand teels you everything about it
- <tool> --help: lets us not browse all documentation and just syntax we need
- some tools like curl just use a -h like curl -h instead of --help
- apropos <term>: seraches all syntax with the term you input in it
- https://explainshell.com/ this link is the final stop if all else fails, it takes us to the documentation
